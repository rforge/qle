This file is intended for further news about bug fixes and further modifications of the package.
The (initial) current version was 0.16-5.

Changes with 0.16-8
---------------------

1) Fixed numerical issues when calculating REML function values for badly conditioned covariance matrices
2) Added bootstrap option for estimating local nugget variances of Cholesky decomposed terms
   during the kriging approximation of variance matrices of statistics
3) Solving linear equations/doing matrix inversions is more robust by `gsiSolve` and `gsiInv` trying a Cholesky decomposition
   first and, if it fails, SVD or finally a Bunch-Kaufman factorization. This may lead to computations of generalized inverse
   matrices or only approximate solutions to the equations.
4) New rigorous checks of possible `NaN`, `NA` and non finite values
