This file is intended for further news about bug fixes and further modifications of the package.
The (initial) current version was 0.16-5.

Changes with 0.16-8
-------------------

1) Fixed numerical issues when calculating REML function values for badly conditioned covariance matrices
2) Added bootstrap option for estimating local nugget variances of Cholesky decomposed terms
   during the kriging approximation of variance matrices of statistics
3) Solving linear equations/doing matrix inversions is more robust by `gsiSolve` and `gsiInv` trying a Cholesky decomposition
   first and, if it fails, SVD or finally a Bunch-Kaufman factorization. This may lead to computations of generalized inverse
   matrices or only approximate solutions to the equations.
4) New rigorous checks of possible `NaN`, `NA` and non finite values

Changes with 0.16-9
-------------------

1) Local test of approximate root is now done only in case the quasi-deviance/quasi-score is numerically not zero
2) C function for FD approximation now uses pre-allocated storage
3) Improved LS in quasi-scoring, now using norm of QS and QD as monitor functions (switching when no progress in LS)
4) If local search was successful, then (even during global phase) use it as the current iteration point
5) Start local search from last sample point (global phase) or last local minimum (local phase) 		  
		  
		  
Current known issues
--------------------
	o flip of sign in quasi-score vector (qscoring)	  
		The implementation of the quasi-scoring iteration has some trouble with the correct
		sign of the quasi-score components for values near zero mostly due to finite precision problems
		
	o function `qleTest` is not yet much meaningful in the final estimated model parameter
	
	
TODO

	o qleTest: modify with new arguments, par, obs
